# I've been working at Kommu sine June of 2022
Kommu is an upcoming residence exchange network, where users can register and swap houses with other verified users, 
enabling affordable lodging during any of their travels.

Feel free to browse through my work.
Here are some previews of what I've created...

# Component that subscribes an email to the Kommu newsletter
When subscribe is clicked, a GET API call is made to check if the email is already a part of the data base. If it is, and the IsSubscribed property is false, a PUT is made to update the IsSubscribed property to true.

If the email is not a part of the database a POST is called to add the email to the database and subscribe them to the newsletter.
